        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Bridgette Kamwana, I am Malawian but I was raised in South
          Africa Cape Town. After spending so many years in South Africa I
          finally returned to the warm heart of Africa, Malawi.I have been here
          since 2023. Not knowing what to do with my life I started doing some
          research and found myself interested in the tech industry.The more I
          researched the more I fell inlove and wanted to start immediatley.
          Unfortunately I did not have the financial means to start a formal
          education, however I came across some free workshops and bootcamps.
          Now here I am on my journey as a software developer.

      <p>
        I love dressing up and going out for brunches, lunches and dinners with
        friends and loved ones.I love learning new skills, any chance I get I'm
        on YouTube learning something new (if it can make me money even
        better).I enjoy watching kdramas, learning korean and listening to
        music. I love baking and cooking for my family and friends. I also love
        to travel and enjoy jogging.
